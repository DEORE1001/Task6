## 🔍 Observations

I tested the password using `passwordmeter.com`, and despite a few weaknesses like repeated characters and consecutive lowercase letters, the score was 100% and marked as **Very Strong**. The high score came mainly from:
- A total length of **23 characters**
- Good combination of **numbers, lowercase letters, and symbols**
- Placement of symbols and numbers in the **middle**, not just at the end

Interestingly, I didn’t use any uppercase letters, yet the password still passed the minimum requirements because it included 3 out of 4 categories.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **Length matters a lot.** Longer passwords contribute the most to strength.
- **Symbols and numbers**, especially in the middle, increase complexity.
- Even without uppercase letters, a password can still be strong if it has enough length and variety.
- Tools like PasswordMeter give useful feedback like “consecutive lowercase” or “repeated characters” that we usually overlook.

## 🧠 Security Takeaways

- **Don’t rely on short or common patterns.** Even if symbols are used, a short password can still be cracked.
- **Passphrases work.** Mixing simple words with numbers and symbols can make something both strong and memorable.
- Avoid placing all numbers/symbols at the end (e.g., `hello123!`), as attackers expect this.
- **Try putting symbols in the middle** like I did — it actually improved the score.

## 🔚 Conclusion

This task helped me understand that password strength isn’t only about using weird characters — it’s also about **structure, unpredictability, and placement**. The feedback from the checker showed how small changes (like adding symbols in the middle) make a big difference.
